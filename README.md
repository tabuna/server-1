## Introduction

Sajya is an open-source project that makes it easy to implement the JSON-RPC 2.0 server specification for Laravel. With Sajya, you can quickly and easily set up a JSON-RPC server that supports all of the features of the specification, including validation of parameters, support for batch and notification requests, and more.

<!--
#### Key features:

- Easy to use: Sajya is designed to be simple to install and use, so you can get your server up and running quickly.
- Customizable: You can customize many aspects of your server, including the routes, parameter validation, and error messages.
- Well-documented: The project comes with complete documentation that includes detailed instructions and a reference guide for all of its features.
- Route Model Binding: You can quickly and easily define routes parameters for your models.
- Validation of parameters: The project automatically validates incoming requests to ensure they meet your specifications. You can also customize the error messages that are returned if the validation fails.
- Support for batch and notification requests: The project supports both batch requests, where multiple requests are combined into a single HTTP request, and notification requests, where the server does not generate a response.
